# ðŸ¤– PriceForwardBot

I was bored. So I made a bot.

Basically, this little bot sits in a **big Discord server** (you know, the ones with like 500k people spamming every 3 seconds), and **sneakily forwards price update messages** to my own private server.

Why? Because the big server doesnâ€™t allow push notifications ðŸ˜­  
So I built my own private alert system instead.

## ðŸ™ƒ Why I Did This

I joined this huge Discord server for deals â€” but they disabled push notifications (probably to avoid frying everyoneâ€™s phones).

> So instead of manually scrolling through noise, I thought:

So yeah... I did that.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Listens like a ninja ðŸ¥· in a **source channel**
- Forwards messages into your **target channel** (your chill, quiet zone)
- Runs 24/7 thanks to free hosting (Render) and caffeine (UptimeRobot)
- Ignores other bots because... bots should mind their own business

## ðŸ§ª Tech Stack

- `Node.js` â€“ JavaScript but with more crying
- `discord.js` â€“ makes talking to Discord API feel like texting
- `express` â€“ keeps the bot alive on Render
- `Render` â€“ free hosting because we donâ€™t pay for stuff we can automate
- `UptimeRobot` â€“ pings the bot so it doesnâ€™t nap forever

## ðŸ›  How to Set It Up (if you're also too online)

### 1. Clone This Thing

### Run It Locally (Just for fun)

```bash
node index.js
```

### OR Deploy to Render (Forever-Free Plan)

1. Push your code to GitHub

2. Log in to Render
3. Create a Web Service
4. Set:
   â€¢ Build Command: npm install
   â€¢ Start Command: node index.js
5. Add environment variables:

### keep it awake with UpTimeRobot

Render naps when itâ€™s bored.

So I added UptimeRobot to ping the bot every 5 minutes.

"Yoo stay awake !!"

Use your Render URL to mintor it ;) thats all..
